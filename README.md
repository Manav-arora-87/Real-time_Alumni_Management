Smart India Hackathon 2022

PROBLEM STATEMENT DETAILS Description - There is a need to create an engaging, supportive alumni network which is crucial to an institutions /organizations success. Currently, there is no mechanism for the Directorate to keep a track of the trainees passing out year by year. This online portal will provide a platform where all the students can interact and help each other by hand-holding in self-employment as well as other job opportunities in the industries

The said application should have the following features:-

(a) allow the Alumni members to register themselves

(b) allow MSDE institutes to verify and authenticate their registered alumni

(c) provision for alumni members to update their details

(d) allow the NSTIs to search details based on criteria such as year, trade, etc.

(e) allow the Directorate/Industries to search details based on criteria such as institute, year, trade etc.

(f) send messages and emails to alumni members

(g) group chats, create events, publish notices on the portal

Such platform will benefit: (i). DGT : Tracer study of alumni whether they are employed in industries, engaged as instructors, self employed, entrepreneurship, any further trainings undergone etc. (ii).For Industries: They may find the best skilled personal relevant to their sector and needs

(iii).For Alumni: better job opportunities, career building, workshops/programs post their training programs. There should be central dashboard to maintain all the activity with detail log report.
